// PreToolUse (Bash): supplies the agent with the actual contents of a push.
//
// Why. The core plugin's autodoc gate denies `git push` with "record ONE entry
// summarizing this whole update". It never says what "update" spans, and the only
// context an agent has is its own session — so it documents its own work. But a
// single push routinely carries more than the one commit this session remembers:
// earlier commits that were never pushed, or work from a prior session.
//
// The gate's text is not ours to edit (plugin cache, overwritten on update), so
// instead of rewriting it we put the missing facts next to it: the commit list from
// the same range the gate uses, and an explicit statement that every commit in that
// range is in scope — not just the one this session authored.
//
// This hook never denies — blocking stays the gate's job. It only adds context.
